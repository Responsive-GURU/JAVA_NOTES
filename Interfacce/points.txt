Interface provide the outline, which can be overriden by any classes

1. Interface methods are by default --> public and abstract
2. Interface declaration should be public or abstract
3. If we need to define a method in interface we use "default" modifier on methods to 
define them.

if there are two interfaces then if one interface extends other interface ... then a 
class implements the extended interface it can access all the abstract mehtods available 
in both the interface.
