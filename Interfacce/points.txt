Interface provide the outline, which can be overriden by any classes

1. Interface methods are by default --> public and abstract
2. Interface declaration should be public or abstract
3. If we need to define a method in interface we use "default" modifier on methods to 
define them.

if there are two interfaces then if one interface extends other interface ... then a 
class implements the extended interface it can access all the abstract mehtods available 
in both the interface.

VARIABLES:
the VARIABLES declared inside interface are public static final by default

TYPES:

FUNCTIONAL INTERFACE ....
The interface which contains only one method is known functional interface.
If an interface is funcitnal interface then we can implement the method using lambda
expression


Adapter class.....
A class implements an interface but it only overrides only some of the methods that is
necessary for the class and another class extends the class which implemented the interface
