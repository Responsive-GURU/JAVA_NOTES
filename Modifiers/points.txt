MODIFIERS:

1.PUBLIC
2.PRIVATE
3.PROTECTED
4.DEFAULT

NOTE :
1. We need to access the data members through an instance(Object) if the data member is 
not static
2. If the data member is static then we can access it directly

if any class contain the main method and it is imported in another packages we can access
the main method of the respective class... and it execution starts without any error.

PUBLIC:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Accessible anywhere in the program and can be accessed in any of the packages...

PRIVATE:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It will be accessible only within the class where the private method is created

Private data member of the class only be available within the class not for the subclasses
that are inherited.


PROTECTED
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Protected data members can be access only within the packages. If we need to access the 
methods in "protected" in other packages we can create a child class for the available
protected method ... class  --> then we  can access it..

DEFAULT
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is available only within the package that the method is created..
if we create a method wihtout any access modifier it is treated as "default" 
class and subclasses within the same package can access it


NON - ACCESS MODIFIERS:
1.abstract
2.static

ABSTRACT
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
abstract keyword is used only for the class and method
1. if a method is not abstract then we need to define the method
2. we cannot use final keyword for the abstract mehtods because it need to be overriden 
by the inherited class
3. we can have a constructor for the abstract class
4. we cannot create an object for the abstract class directly 
5. abstract method implementation should be done by its inherited class without fail


STATIC:
It is a keyword which used to access all the data members of the class by class name of by 
its name.

static blocks are executed at the time of class loading 
it is mainly used for variable initialization.
if a variable or method is Declared as static it is shared through all the instances of the class
so the memory is allocated only once
