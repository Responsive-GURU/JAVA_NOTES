String a = "guru" 
memory will be allocated in SCP and the reference will be stored in heap

String b = new String("bharan");
this bharan will be create in SCP and the copy will be created in heap memory, reference 
will be pointing out in heap


String c = "guru"
String d = new String("guru")

for a literal guru will be create in SCP and referenced by c
for an object if the string is already present in SCP then its copy will be created in heap
and the reference will be pointing out

vice versa for 
String e = new String("bharan");
String f = "bharan";
